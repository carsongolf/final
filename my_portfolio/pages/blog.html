    <p><img src="../Images/rain.jpg" width="612" height="326" alt=""/><span style="font-family: vaccine, serif">Out of all the famous and impactful psychologists in history, Erik Erikson had to be the most influential. Hereâ€™s why: his theories showed us how social developments affect our personality and human behavior throughout our entire lifespan.</span>  His work on psychological development in humans practically changed the field of psychology entirely by basically flipping the stage on itself. Each stage in Erikson's theory builds on the preceding stages and creates a path for the next stage (VeryWellMind, 2020). The basis of this theory relies on conflict, specifically conflict being the main turning point for psychological development. When a person goes through a great deal of pain and anguish, they commonly find a dramatic change in their mental state and infrastructure. This also applies on the opposite spectrum if a person fails to overcome a conflict or trial.
